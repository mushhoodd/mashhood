				<h3>La Rue du Pot o Beer</h3>
				<p>La Rue du Pot o Beer<br />

				<h3>Dry Talk</h3>

				<h3>Six Scones</h3>
				<p>Six Scones<br />

				<h3>Bird nest at your feet</h3>
				<p>I’m working on the casts, talking shit up at nile creek<br />

				<h3>throwing a nymph into the shadows</h3>
				<p>When I’m standing in a nice<br />

					might get stuck<br />
					in the mud<br />
					while trying</p>

					on the edge of the dugout<br />
					or a little hut<br />
					to sit in</p>

				
	
				<h3>My Little Eye</h3>

					with each beer that I steal from pa<br />
					and then drink</p>

				<h3>Pertoglyphs and Pterodactyls</h3>
				<p>Pertoglyphs and Pterodactyls<br />
					go whispering awhile<br />
					and I go flitting<br />
					through quennel lake<br />
					as summer dies out</p>

				<h3>low tide</h3>
				<p>Plenty of gulls<br />
					to crack the skulls<br />
					of tiny crabs<br />
					whose job it is<br />
					to waddle about<br />
					when the tide is out</p>

				<h3>Jainland</h3>
				<p>A crazy place this is in the wet of winter Jainland<br />
					in the darkness of my hut hunting for hares<br />
					or the neighbours dogs, guarding the plains of Nestpatitas<br />
					and things in that vein.</p>

				<h3>Marmalade</h3>
				<p>Marmalade my, quintessential spread<br />
					who arms are always open on lonely mornings</p>

				<h3>Budget Soup</h3>
				<p>pull the cheap strings of cheap dreams<br />
					and poach the eggs of Chinese ducklings.<br />
					cheap beans in the simple soil<br />
					freshley picked by the cheap labour.<br />
					the hot sun sends cheapness into the roots<br />
					of cheap fruit which then is blended<br />
					into budget soup.</p>

				<h3>non-socks</h3>
				<p>Sunshine slithers down my shins<br />
					towards my non-socks<br />
					to rest upon<br />

				<h3>blues from the orient</h3>
				<p>Itay woke up from a bad dream, hard<br />
					he couldn’t get back to sleep<br />
					and the next day he had to work<br />
					but not until eleven o’clock in the morning<br />

				<p>but at seven the construction would begin<br />
					and no one can sleep through that</p>

				<p>he sat up late listening the neighbors<br />
					and Yusef Lateef’s eastern sounds</p>

				<p>sleep came to Itay like finely ground coffee<br />
					dripping through the sheppard’s crook<br />
					of Lateef’s bassoon</p>

				<p>milked along, watered by spit<br />
					from the boot through the bocal<br />
					to the double reeds then down his throat</p>
			
			<h3>Bush Bean</h3>
				<p>I picked the fruit of the bush bean,<br />
					bundled it into my shirt,<br />
					tossed the soft ones to the hens<br />
					and ran the bean marathon<br />
					with just enough for one</p>
				<p>the young sweet greens<br />
					par-boiled in the fog<br />
					just barely peppered<br />
					yet edible and friendly</p>

				<h3>Manzanita</h3>
				<p>In the fog of manzanita I'm able to hide<br />
					and pretend Im the only one<br />
					and that the forest stretches on as does the sea</p>

				<h3>Work Week</h3>
				<p>In the work week my heart hurts<br />
					and I taste some painful things<br />
					metallic and dust<br />
					and sweat stings my eyes<br />
					and boredom hangs around<br />
					and wonder wanders through</p>

				<h3>Grass</h3>
				<p>I ate the lawn that gets too long<br />
					with my grizzly bear who hugged the ground<br />
					and spit smoke and dust while my eyes got red<br />
					near some motel where I pick up trash in the parking lot</p>

				<h3>Champagne Hill</h3>
				<p>Like a boat come loose of it’s moorings<br />
					or even a dock drifting in the cove at night</p>

				<p>I wait for her on top of Champagne Hill<br />
					forecasting winter by fire</p>

				<h3>cheese</h3>
				<p>Cheese, Cheese,<br />
					all kinds of lactose<br />
					coming ultimately out of teets<br />
					to sit in sauce or water<br />
					or growl within<br />
					cold deep caves</p>
