<h1>10 Books I Probably Should Have Read</h1>

<p class="muted small">First published on Apr 21, 2021</p>
 
<p>Whether you're starting a business, launching a product, trying to get rich, getting fit, wanting to self-improve, developing a side hustle or just merely existing, there are some books that are recommended at every turn. Books that 'everyone must read', essential' and 'life-changing'.</p>
<p>They have become so commonplace in recommendations that I have developed a sort of learned blindness; whenever I read such a list or somebody recommends books to me I gloss over and ignore those I am most aware of.</p>
<p>The question I am interested in: <em>are they actually any good?</em> I have a suspicion that a lot of the authors of the aforementioned lists may not have fully digested or read the books themselves or even rate them highly. There is a group think that occurs when you are told something is excellent: when you go to list things you think are brilliant you are inclined to mention the items you know to be considered high quality as to validate your other choices.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, they really are as good as they are supposed to be. Below are ten books that are consistently recommended that I <em>haven't</em> read. These will be my next ten reads come hell or high water. The titles will, in time, become links to a short summary and review and eventually I'll consider the question again.</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</strong> by Stephen R. Covey</li>
<li><strong>How to Win Friends and Influence People</strong> by Dale Carnegie</li>
<li><strong>Zero to One</strong> by Peter Thiel</li>
<li><strong>The 4-Hour Work Week</strong> by Tim Ferriss</li>
<li><strong>The 48 Laws of Power</strong> by Robert Greene</li>
<li><strong>Shoe Dog</strong> by Phil Knight</li>
<li><strong>Awaken the Giant Within</strong> by Anthony Robbins</li>
<li><strong>War of Art</strong> by Steven Pressfield</li>
<li><strong>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</strong> by Richard Feynman</li>
<li><strong>Black Swan</strong> by Nassim Nicholas Taleb</li>
</ul>
<p><br />That's quite a list. I wonder if I develop 7 Habits and learn 48 Laws in 4 hour weeks I'll Awaken the Giant? Time will tell.</p>
