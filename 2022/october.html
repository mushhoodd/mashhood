    <h1>October 2022</h1>
    <p>Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. (<a href="../2021-review-2022-goals.1.html">details</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Progress from <a href="september.html">September</a> - In the words of The Dude: <a href="https://youtu.be/sYsw0KVRjCM">strikes and gutters</a>. Finishing on a high.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Carve spoons</strong> - Three started, one finished (my favourite one yet). Lots learnt along the way about using chisels, sharpening and a few new cutting techniques.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Bake more bread</strong> - A single wonderful white loaf. It was delicious and fed us for a long weekend.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Functional Programming</strong> - It is hard. Really hard. But I've studied for many, many hours and feel like I am beginning to see daylight.</li>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">Do nothing</strong> - An overcomplicated and busy internal and external month.</li>
</ul>
<br />

<p>New goals for October 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="green-background">Write new post</strong> - I've been making notes on working as a software engineer at a small, scrappy start-up vs a large, established corporate finance company. It might be interesting. It might not be.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Make book list</strong> - I saw a great site on Hacker News where the author listed all of their reads in order with minor commentary/review. Not dissimilar to <a href="https://sive.rs/book">this</a> by Derek Sivers. I read a lot and then forget what I've read. I'm going to develop some sort of pragmatic solution and keep track publicly.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Decorate office</strong> - It's not <em>undecorated</em> but it could do with some artwork, a few licks of paint and some general love. 50% of my work week is spent in here so it should be beautiful.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Get to MVP of Upstand</strong> - I've been loosely working on a side project, Upstand, for a couple of weeks and want to get to MVP. Will need to <em>write</em> an MVP first...</li>
</ul>
