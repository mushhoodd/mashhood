    <h1>April 2022</h1>
    <p>Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. (<a href="../2021-review-2022-goals.1.html">details</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Progress from <a href="march.html">March</a> - Great month. Best of the year so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Eat at Michelin Star Restaurant</strong> - We went to <a href="https://www.leroyshoreditch.com/">Leroy</a> in Shoreditch. Fantastic food. Well worth the trip.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish Three Half Finished Books</strong> - All done. The James Smith book was solid, Mental Models Vol. 1 was brilliant(I've bought the second two volumes) and The Book of EST was bizarre but excellent. Continued by finishing two others before the end of the month.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Start Goggins Project</strong> - Started and finished. Published Goggins Blocker Chrome Extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goggins-blocker/kpnafocdjkofgnpaafppplaghogpgadk">here</a>.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Write Career Post/Thoughts</strong> - Wrote it and got some excellent feedback and responses. Find it <a href="../thoughts-on-career.html">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>New goals for April 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="green-background">Fix Posture</strong> - I've always had bad posture which has been exacerbated by a career in front of a desk. Resources I'm using include <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Overcoming-Poor-Posture-Systematic-Performance/dp/194755400X">Overcoming Poor Posture</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Posture/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all">r/posture</a></li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Start Naval's 60 Minute 60 Day Meditation Practice</strong> - Naval's original <a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856">twitter thread</a> explains the concept and his thinking. 60 minutes of meditation for 60 days to reset the mind. Interesting write ups and discussion <a href="https://sameerbajaj.com/OneHourMeditation/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/meditation-mental-strength">here</a>, <a href="https://www.deepanseeralan.com/random/my-thoughts-on-completing-naval's-60-day-meditation/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.thenow.co/naval-ravikant-meditation/">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">No News</strong> - I won't lie, I'm addicted. I know the latest troop movements in Ukraine. I know who attended Prince Phillip's memorial service. It's a waste of energy and never has a positive impact on my life. I read <a href="https://www.alaindebotton.com/news-users-manual/">The News: A User's Manual</a> by Alain de Botton a few years ago and he makes fantastic and poignant points. A good video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I08u0eKvwUY">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Invest</strong> - My new job has given me a significant set of stock options. It has inspired me to understand the market with some conviction and start dipping my toe into the investment waters. All recommendations and advice appreciated!</li>
