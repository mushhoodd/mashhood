    <h1>August 2022</h1>
    <p>Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. (<a href="../2021-review-2022-goals.1.html">details</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Progress from <a href="june.html">June</a> - No update from June or July, life has been a little crazy with the new job, some traveling, some ups and some downs. It's now the 22nd August; over 80 days since the last
update. There are only 10 days left in the month so the goals set are minimal but I fully intend to get back on the goal setting in September.</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">Set up website/area for photography</strong> - Nope.</li>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">15 hours on the Peloton</strong> - Nope.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Great first month at Tipalti</strong> - Coming up on 3 months now and enjoying it throughly. Lots learnt, lots to learn.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Origami</strong> - Not lots, but some. Very relaxing and meditative.</li>
</ul>

<p>New goals for August 2022.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="green-background">Set up website/area for photography</strong> - Round 2. Have a new camera and plenty to post.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Knife sharpening</strong> - I've not carved anything for a while, in part because I need to sharpen my knives which I don't know how to do.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Finish flat improvements (reframing, remounting)</strong> - We were going to move to a new place this year but given the insane financial markets have decided to stay put and weather the storm. There are a few home improvements I've been procrastinating on that need to be finished.</li>
</ul>
