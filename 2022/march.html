    <h1>March 2022</h1>
    <p>Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. (<a href="../2021-review-2022-goals.1.html">details</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Progress from <a href="february.html">February</a> - I had a great month. I turned 31 - some wins, some losses. Some strikes, some gutters. Lots learnt, lots to learn.</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">Run 5km</strong> - Two months in a row. Have been on the Peloton a lot but haven't laced up my running shoes once.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish Epic React</strong> - Tick. Lots learnt. Naturally I immediately get a new job that will primarily be writing C# rather than JavaScript/React. More on that another time.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">3 Day Fast</strong> - A little late, it bled into March...but done. I haven't fasted for a long time and it was tough but well worth it. Physically tiring but the mental clarity was blissful.</li>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">No Complaining</strong> - A good start to the month - the first 10 or so days were noticeably improved and then I fell of the wagon. Have got the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complaint-Free-World-21-day-challenge/dp/0753513463">book</a> now and will be continuing.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish/Update Portfolio</strong> - Done. Tidied. Lots more to do but all the issues I had previously noticed were resolved.</li>
</ul>

<p>New goals for March 2022</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="green-background">Eat at Michelin Star Restaurant</strong> - I've eaten at a couple - but not for a while. Any recommendations?</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Finish Three Half Finished Books</strong> - I've become terrible at half finishing books and moving on...<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Not-Life-Coach-Boundaries-Potential/dp/B08BCTZ2N5">Not a Life Coach</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Great-Mental-Models-Systems-Mathematics/dp/1999449061/">The Great Mental Models Vol.1</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Book-Est-Luke-Rhinehart/dp/0557306159">The Book of Est</a></li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Start Goggins Project</strong> - I'm creating a repository of all David Goggins interviews and content + remaking my LaBeouf Blocker as a Goggins Blocker.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Write Career Post/Thoughts</strong> - I'm moving from my current company to a Fintech. Lots of thoughts on how, why and general considerations when entering and navigating tech careers.</li>
</ul>
