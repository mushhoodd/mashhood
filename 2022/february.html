    <h1>February 2022</h1>
    <p>Rather than a traditional process of yearly resolutions I am experimenting with a more targeted monthly
system of goal setting. (<a href="../2021-review-2022-goals.1.html">details</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>Progress from <a href="january.html">January</a> - lots learnt and already I believe my feelings towards monthly rather than yearly resolutions
are justified. Two successes, one abject failure and two that sit somewhere in between.</p>
<ul>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">Run 5km</strong> - Never got started. Have been training resistance regularly and ride the Peloton a few times a week but just couldn't get the energy and motivation to lace up the running shoes.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Finish flat</strong> - Painting, framing, mirrors and shelves - all done.</li>
<li>✅ <strong class="green-background">Carve a spoon</strong> - The biggest success of the month. Little brought me more joy that sitting quietly in the evening whittling away at a small piece of oak. I posted a photo and some info on <a href="https://twitter.com/MrRoryFlint/status/1488270018332794880">Twitter</a>.</li>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">Write at least two essays</strong> - I love writing - I started lots and finished only one: <a href="../too-much-information.1.html">Too Much Information</a>.</li>
<li>❌ <strong class="green-background">Finish Epic React</strong> - I'm about half way through. 90% is completely familiar to me but I have picked up interesting tidbits along the way. Will continue into February.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<hr>
<br />
<p>Some goals are brought over from January and a couple of new ones added to the mix. See you on the other side.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="green-background">Run 5km</strong> - I don't want to do it, I really don't. Which is why I must.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Finish Epic React</strong> - Finish what I have started - the further into the course, the more advanced the gems become.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">3 Day Fast</strong> - Fasting is a fascinating thing - I've fasted for 1, 3 and 7 days and enjoyed the benefits and challenge each time. It has been a couple of years since I last tried - time to go again.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">No Complaining</strong> - I moaned, complained and acted negatively too much last month. Nobody cares, there is no advancement in complaining. <a href="https://tim.blog/2007/09/18/real-mind-control-the-21-day-no-complaint-experiment/">Tim Ferriss</a> has written about it and I believe most of what is said holds true - it is well worth the read.</li>
<li><strong class="green-background">Finish/Update Portfolio</strong> - It's out of date, I have so many new projects to add - I've just been lazy.</li>
</ul>
