<h1>2022 Review + 2023 Goals</h1>

At the end of 2021 I decided to abandon the traditional New Year’s Resolutions in favour of setting goals <a href="../2021-review-2022-goals.1.html">month by month</a>. I decided on four themes that would serve as threads holding the goals together throughout the year.</p>
<h2>2022</h2>
<p>From a simple data perspective it went as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>I set goals 10 out of 12 months</li>
<li>I set 41 individual goals</li>
<li>21 goals were successful (52%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not great. I’ve been pondering the successes and failures over the past few days and, whilst far from definitive, have concluded that I lost sight of the over-arching themes and descended into making a high level to-do list rather than actionable and important goals.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it was all a failure. The monthly accountability proved excellent for getting things done that I wouldn't have otherwise. Things like <span class="green-background">Eat at a Michelin star restaurant</span>, which I ended up doing five times, or <span class='green-background'>Research and buy new camera</span>. These are things I’ve wanted to do but quickly forget about or de-prioritised. The monthly review and goal setting was a great way of keeping my ADHD riddled brain on track and getting things done.</p>
<p>It is apparent that the system fails when things are hard. Any goal that would be of significant effort, especially if fitness related, quickly failed. I tried multiple times to get back into running, to hit Peloton targets and develop a sustained meditation practice. These things that were difficult were easily dismissed and became failed goals.</p>
<h2>Themes</h2>
<p>The four themes I hoped to focus on were Physical Fitness, Mental Fitness/Health, Leaning and Career.</p>
<p>My physical fitness and health are significantly worse now than at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Mental fitness/health is fairly unchanged; ups and downs, strikes and gutters.</p>
<p>Learning, similarly, has been up and down. Lots of big moments of progress and then laziness and lack of discipline to push further.</p>
<p>Career is the standout. I moved to a new company in June and have significantly increased financial freedom, future opportunities and general work satisfaction.</p>
<h2>2023 and Beyond</h2>
<p>I had an epiphany recently that I am sure many other people have already had. I am not promising anything new or original.

<strong class="green-background">Physical fitness and health are everything.</strong></p>
<p>Everything. Every goal, every idea and everything I do and want to achieve is either drastically heightened by excellent health or prevented in part by poor fitness. Everything.</p>
<p>So that’s it. I will stick to the monthly system to keep myself accountable but there are no themes beyond physical fitness and health. I have faith that everything else will begin to fall into place.</p>
<p>I wish you every success for the coming 12 months. Happy New Year!</p>
